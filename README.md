# Hacker-Stories
Project from "The Road to React" 2022 edition

I followed the book closely for the first section of the book 'Fundamentals of React' , with the exception of also using Typescript from the start. The
work for this first half of the book is located in the dev branch. From there, I will branch off dev for the subsequent isolated chapters. See the chapter 
headings in the table of contents for the corresponding branch names. I've done it this way to follow the author's advice of performing the chapters in isolation
with the foundation for each chapter being the point reached by the end of 'Fundamentals of React' (see page 150 for diagram). Note that for the 'Styling in React' chapter , which has sub chapters , I will branch off the main 'styling-in-react' branch instead of the top level dev branch. Example:

dev -> styling-in-react
styling-in-react -> css-in-react   ( svg part will be in this branch as well )
styling-in-react -> css-modules-in-react
styling-in-react -> styled-components-in-react
